\section*{Abstract}
The reasons for the increase in the Abitur grades have been a fiercly discussed topic in society. Often it is called a grade inflation. In this paper we will show why this is not the case. Student competence has increased. One of the most important factors is the student teacher ratio. We will show that this metric has a high correlation with the Abitur grades.
