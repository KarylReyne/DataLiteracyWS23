The steady increase in Abitur grades indicates grade inflation in German schools. This study analyzes the factors influencing the children's performance in the German school system through exploratory data analysis. Examining variables such as student numbers, teacher ratios, repeaters, and budget per child, the research aims to both describe and correlate these factors. The findings challenge the idea that grade inflation is the only cause of rising grades and emphasize the importance of having a small student-to-teacher ratio.
