\section{Conclusion}
We have introduced a new approach to explaining the increasing Abitur grades. There is a very strong correlation between the student-teacher ratio and the Abitur grades. Additionally, we also found a negative correlation between this ratio and the repeater number. This means that the number of teachers not only has a positive impact on the grades but also on the more challenged students. Improving the budget does not necessarily help. It is essential for the German education system to have enough teachers available.

Grade inflation in the Abitur grades has not been scientifically proven so far. What has been proven is that student competence is increasing. It is important to acknowledge that the student-teacher ratio is not the only factor at play in improving education and, thus, student competence. Multiple factors are at play; some are already known through research, and some still need to be discovered. We have shown that the student-teacher ratio is a crucial one.
