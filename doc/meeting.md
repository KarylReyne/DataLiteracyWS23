# Meeting
## Teacher
### results
- teacher-student ratio is constant over the years
- number of school kids might slightly increase in the future
### prospects
- What is the number of new teachers over the years
- how are the age categories developing over time
- Use those data to predict the development of the number of teachers and the teacher-student ratio in the future
## School budget
### results
- budget for schools/education is constantly increasing over the years (normalized budget)
- there are notable differences in development of budgeting of the different federal states
### prospects
- investigate if there is a correlation between school budgeting and abitur grades in the different federal states
## Repeaters
### results 
- The absulute number of repeaters is decreasing over the years (2020 barely any)
- percentage of students with secondary degree is decreasing
- there seems to be a positive correlation between children with special needs and pisa results
### prospects
- investigate if the relative number of repeaters is also decreasing
- further investigate the correlation between children with special needs from the pisa results
- investigate if and where the Pisa results fit in our argument. Is the fact that they only compare to different countries a problem, since we are only interested in germany?
