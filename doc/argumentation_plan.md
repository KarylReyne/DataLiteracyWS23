# Argumentation Plan (23.01.2024)

## 1. Introduction

- Grade Inflation --> Abi-Plot
- (Maybe not inflation) more rising grades
- ... see paper
- Explain why we focus on the data until 2021:
  - Before COVID: Afterwards more different causes
  - Teacher data set goes only until 2021 and thus the ratio is only defined until 2020

## 2. Related Work

## Importance of Children per Teacher ratio

- More Budget --> More Teachers (in old federal states)
- Correlation between the avg. grade in the ABI and the students per teacher ration is 0.98 --> really hight, nearly linear (refer to plot)
- Also the correlation between repeaters and students per teacher is high --> think about adding it to the same plot as the school types
- Plot of the students per teacher ratio where the ratio is decreasing in all school types: Idea decreasing ratio -> better grades (correlation)

## Correlation Student per

- Plot of the correlation between students per teachers and grades (maybe combined with repeaters).
- High correlation between both
- Number of teachers should have a big impact

## Difference Federal States

- Heatmap with differences in the correlations of Budget and Repeaters
- Look deeper into the possible causes, why the new federal states have different (unexpected correlation)
  - Delete outliers which may cause the bad correlation with the repeaters
- Analyse papers explaining how the different federal states invest their budgets: Idea digitalization and new schools may have an equal big effect as the students per teacher ratio.

## Prognoses how the grades may evolve in future if the hypothesis is true

- Since the KMK expects less teachers and more students the ratio will get higher.
- Thus, the grades should not increase as fast it was the last year, if the hypothesis holds.
- Else other aspects will also influence the grades: Digitalization, Financial Background of the children, Academic degree of the parents, ...
- These aspects should be studied in future to validate the hypothesis of this paper
